Teleport around, explore the arena, have a conversation, or do a silly dance together. Once you are ready, join into the arena for a casual game. Simply guess what someone else is drawing or draw something for others to guess. NEW: multiplayer MR Paintball, splatter your friends or the arena with lovely colors. Remember to dodge and refill!\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Paint_Arena and share videos or screenshots of your best 3D paintings or MR paintball games with hashtag #Paint_Arena :)\r\n\r\nConceptualization: \r\nMany virtual reality games today are designed to enhance graphic intensity and immersion, but increasingly isolate the players. We believe Windows Mixed Reality can be much more than that. We decided to design a casual game that people of all ages can play, share, and socialize in mixed reality. We were inspired by a classic interactive puzzle game for friends and family, while we were amazed by the potential of the mixed reality motion controllers, so Paint Arena was born. Many thanks to Mixed Reality Academy for the paint brush example.  \r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\nYou will need a HoloLens or a WMR immersive headset with a mixed reality motion controllers (and headphones, if not Samsung Odyssey) to enjoy this experience.\r\n\r\nThis social experience is best enjoyed in a casual standing pose. If you feel you are not at the right height after app launch, simply stand up, look forward, and say or tap \"Reset Floor Level\". \r\n\r\nYou could draw and talk to others and guess each others' drawings. If you are the first one to join, you would be assigned the drawer for the first round. You would be given a random word. Draw something to help others guess the word (without drawing any letters or digits). Once someone guesses your word correctly, a guesser will chosen at random to become the drawer. \r\n\r\nToggle \"Painting On\" to \"Paint Balling\" to start shooting paintballs and splatter the arena. Each full tank contains 100 paintballs. Every 5 seconds, you can partially refill the tank with 20 paintballs by pressing \"Refill 20 Paintballs\" button or saying the voice command \"Refill Paint Ball\". Try to move around to dodge incoming paintballs, or teleport to reposition. Score by reducing others' health bars to zero, upon which they would enter ghost mode and respawn at a random location in 10 seconds. \r\n\r\nIn Immersive headsets: Make sure you set up boundary for all experiences before you begin. While \"Painting On\", once you see your robotic right hand holding a paint brush, you can press the right hand trigger button to start drawing. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your right hand controller, and press right hand trigger to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nOnce you see your robotic left arm holding a motion controller, you can use the touch pad to select paint color. Alternatively, you can tap \"Pick Color\" to bring up the large color wheel. \r\n\r\nIf you made a mistake, you can say \"Erase Last Stroke\" or press right hand controller grab button. You can also clear all strokes by saying \"Erase All Strokes\". \r\n\r\nTo rotate your view, point the joysticks left or right on one of the motion controllers. \r\n\r\nTo teleport, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then point your cursor at the floor with one of the motion controllers, and hold the joystick forward until a Teleport marker appears, then release the joystick. \r\n\r\nIn HoloLens, you can use gaze, tap gesture to select options on the menu in front of you (look below chest level). You can use the same voice commands as elaborated above. While \"Painting On\", you can reach your hand out in front of you, pinch and hold while dragging the paint brush along. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your gaze and air tap to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nBefore teleporting in HoloLens, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then you can use your gaze to aim, and then tap to dash across the map! You could also hide the Guessing Window and the Panel if they are blocking your gazes. Remember to turn off teleport before drawing or shooting. \r\n\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NJMQSPR02W0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"POBA Battlegrounds","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63095.13673716401139813.1555fa43-3e5d-4360-8ed6-5ade35830520.4d142345-771a-4fe5-9cb6-7f209a62ff5c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36327.13673716401139813.1555fa43-3e5d-4360-8ed6-5ade35830520.d3651e2d-9f54-4bfd-98fe-3ea2997cc678","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56889.13673716401139813.1555fa43-3e5d-4360-8ed6-5ade35830520.2a7b43c9-8a03-4b05-9da4-2ce742ed21ce","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55824.13673716401139813.1555fa43-3e5d-4360-8ed6-5ade35830520.983d5c4f-4edd-44a1-ae58-5e5544ec0cb1","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50950.13673716401139813.1555fa43-3e5d-4360-8ed6-5ade35830520.8966fd1f-aed2-4184-9899-511bddd2c055","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60323.13673716401139813.1555fa43-3e5d-4360-8ed6-5ade35830520.4dff887c-0303-4f8c-9b3c-353ebfb98eb0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51322.13673716401139813.1555fa43-3e5d-4360-8ed6-5ade35830520.357ce577-7a25-4c88-b894-914f9cbc43bd","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51612.13673716401139813.1555fa43-3e5d-4360-8ed6-5ade35830520.03462659-1672-46e3-b3b8-3daa7bd11c6c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2485.13673716401139813.1555fa43-3e5d-4360-8ed6-5ade35830520.77c943e6-ab64-4014-a8d4-83fe78a6cb40","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32345Akashicgames.1559044E5079C_7464049jnah78"],"ContentIds":["8c680375-2224-8769-7ace-1da24fd4ac8b","1b2ddc71-4d96-71d4-aa42-652efa56001e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"POBA or Polygonal Battlefield is a cool third-person shooter with awesome polygonal graphics and fun multiplayer gameplay.

Spending money on different objects that we simply don't need is definitely not a smart thing to do. However, sales could be also very useful. We wish to have certain object or we really need it but its price is simply too high. In that case we wait for the sale and get them on reasonable price.\r\n\r\nMartha and Lori work as shop assistants in one small shopping center. Traditionally, every year, they organize sales that has been very famous in the city where they live. It is something like a holiday because the sale always offers rather decreased prices so everyone could afford to buy the object that he/she always wanted. People even decide not to go to work on this day and dedicate the whole day on shopping. That way they will save some money and allow themselves different modern objects and clothes.\r\n\r\nEven though this day is a really wonderful and noble day, Martha and Lori know that this will be a rather difficult day for them, with a lot of hard work. Since everyone knows about the day and impatiently waits for it, it means that numerous people will come to buy something from that shopping center. This means that they will have a lot of work and they could really use some extra hand. In the game you will play as their colleague. Since you are one of the employees, you will have todeal with a certain group of costumers and serve them on the best and the fastest possible way.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P7RHQN36CD1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pet Surfers Subway","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47052.14102328549716210.e3f93072-d647-4d3a-9791-252ef3c2d405.33af5626-04b2-4525-b014-3fa1b1ba14ef","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18662.14102328549716210.a0a679ca-1d85-4aef-bb2a-67d66ce8b664.644cadb6-d331-45f8-b938-15f6d9f480db","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47052.14102328549716210.e3f93072-d647-4d3a-9791-252ef3c2d405.33af5626-04b2-4525-b014-3fa1b1ba14ef","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["59192DragonPokeGames.PetSurfersSubway_dqa1dx3zdn60e"],"ContentIds":["2bc63c15-b4e0-41ff-ef10-4ad60fffc0fb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pet Run is the best free subway themed endless run game where you can meet you new best friend and go for a run!

Our flappy friend migrated to another amusement island further in the south, where you can find the coolest mini golf tracks placed on an exotic beach.  Many trucks are littered with old clay pots that could obstruct your way.  Smash them to free your way to the hole.

The child is given three digits and two operators and has to compose the case him/herself.\r\nWhat’s so special about it? The child visually memorizes the case itself and can see what will happen if he changes the digits. Now there is no need to scissor out paper digits. The program itself indicates whether or not your child has composed the case right.\r\n \r\n“Training” is an easy-to-handle tool for effective instruction of your child. Forget about countless slips of paper with cases written on them! Everything is right here: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. After solving the problem the results are saved and can be seen on the stats page, the graph represents the results and the number of errors. This helps to track the dynamics of learning.\r\n \r\nOnce your child has learnt to solve the cases, you won’t have to study with him.
